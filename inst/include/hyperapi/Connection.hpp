     * The template parameter `T` has to be set to the anticipated value type of the column, which
     * is the type that the respective `getTYPE` method of the class `Row` would return.
     *
     * An exception to this rule are the types `string_view` and `ByteSpan`, because these are
     * non-owning references into the query result. When the method returns, the result is
     * already deconstructed, so we need to return an owning reference instead,
     * which is `std::string` for `string_view` and `std::vector<uint8_t>` for `ByteSpan`.
     * E.g., for the type `Text`, `Row::getText` would return `string_view`, so `T` would need
     * to be `std::string`. Using the wrong type here will cause an exception at runtime.
     *
     * Another exception to the rule is that this method generally allows larger integer types than
     * the query uses. So a query producing an `INTEGER` can be templated with an `int32_t` or
     * an `int64_t`.
     *
     * Finally, all types can be retrieved using `T = std::vector<uint8_t>`, which will
     * result in calling the `getRaw` method to get the raw binary representation of the type.
     * Note that the binary representation is not part of the supported interface, so it can change
     * between versions.
     *
     * By default, the return type of this method is `T`. If the result can be NULL however,
     * then T has to be an optional<>; otherwise,
     * a NULL value would result in an exception at runtime.
     *
     * ```
     * int                     i1 = executeScalarQuery<int>("...");
     * hyperapi::optional<int> i2 = executeScalarQuery<optional<int>(...);
     * ```

     * \throw  HyperException
